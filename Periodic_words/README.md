## Elemental Configurations

periodic_words.py can take any word and find all possible configurations of periodic element symbols that can be used to express the word. I found this to be a fun project, as I've seen all kinds of Geek merch with these configurations. Using a recursive branching algorithm I can find any possible elemental configuration of a word. See the code comments for a more in depth explanation of how the algorithm works. This code has also been adapted to take file input to analyze large numbers of words, but now it's written in an interactive mode.
